# Ran Yakumo
Ran Yakumo is both a controller of shikigami, as well as a shikigami herself. She's a nine-tailed fox in service to Yukari Yakumo, as well as Chen's master.
In addition to the already mythical magical power of a nine-tailed fox, she is further empowered by her connection to her mistress. As a result, she is one of the most powerful beings to wield magic.
She possesses a brilliant mind, which she often turns to such things as mathematics and its applications. As Yukari spends much time sleeping, Ran has much spare time with which to unravel the mysteries of the world.
She is completely subservient to Yukari, taking care of most of her duties and acting in her stead while she hibernates. She can be found anywhere that her duties take her. She's typically a reasonable and peaceful person, unless it comes to protecting Yukari or Chen.

Alias: Shikigami of the Gap Youkai, Unusual Animal, Nine-Tailed Tactician, Wishfully Busy Shikigami.

### Roleplaying Notes
- **Personality Traits:** Ran Yakumo is diligent and highly intelligent, often appearing serious and composed. She values efficiency and order, diligently performing her duties as Yukari Yakumo's shikigami. Ran is polite and respectful, especially towards her master and those she deems worthy of respect. Despite her stern exterior, she cares deeply for her own shikigami, Chen, and can show a nurturing side.
- **Ideals:** Ran is driven by loyalty and a strong sense of responsibility. She believes in fulfilling her duties to the best of her ability and upholding the balance and harmony of Gensokyo.
- **Bonds:** Her primary bond is with Yukari Yakumo, whom she serves faithfully. Ran also shares a maternal relationship with her own shikigami, Chen, guiding and protecting her. She interacts with other youkai and humans as part of her responsibilities, forming connections based on mutual respect and duty.
- **Flaws:** Ran can be overly serious and may neglect her own well-being in the pursuit of her duties. Additionally, she sometimes forgets her position as a servant and acts on her own volition, which may lead to consequences Yukari does not expect.

## Lore
Ran Yakumo is a powerful nine-tailed fox youkai and the shikigami of Yukari Yakumo, one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in Gensokyo. As a shikigami, Ran is bound to serve Yukari, managing many of her affairs during Yukari's frequent slumbers. This includes maintaining barriers, gathering information, and occasionally intervening in incidents that threaten the balance of Gensokyo.
She was formerly a resident of the Animal Realm, presumably being one of the many spirits inhabiting it. At one point, disgusted by the beastly ideology that pervaded the place, she fled to Gensokyo. It is unknown when Ran met Yukari and became her shikigami.
Ran's relationship with her own shikigami, Chen, showcases her nurturing side. She acts as a mentor and caretaker, teaching Chen and guiding her development.
Throughout Gensokyo, Ran is known for her intelligence and effectiveness. However, some may view her as distant or unapproachable due to her serious demeanor and focus on duty. She occasionally interacts with key figures like Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame, especially when incidents arise that require her attention.

### Adventure Hooks
Since she often carries out various chores from Yukari, she can basically be everywhere that players can encounter if related to the balance of Gensokyo. Is it possible that she lends help to the party if necessary or fighting players in extreme circumstances, but most likely a Danmaku duel rather than actual battle.

> ##### Author's Notes
> Ran is a very typical "mommy" character among Touhou community, acting as a maternal figure between Yukari and Chen, but with a mysterious background aligns with Yukari's. After the release of UDOALG where she became a playable character, revealing her relation with Yuuma Toutetsu and in Strange Creators of Outer World mentioned the fact that she's a spirit possessing a nine-tail fox, adds more layers to her character and more questions to answer. Nevertheless, since her behavior is always consistent in both canon and the majority of fanon, it's safe to say that the Ran we see is still the complete character of the good fox everyone recognizes.
