# Ran Yakumo
Ran Yakumo is both a controller of shikigami, as well as a shikigami herself. She's a nine-tailed fox in service to Yukari Yakumo, as well as Chen's master.
In addition to the already mythical magical power of a nine-tailed fox, she is further empowered by her connection to her mistress. As a result, she is one of the most powerful beings to wield magic.
She possesses a brilliant mind, which she often turns to such things as mathematics and its applications. As Yukari spends much time sleeping, Ran has much spare time with which to unravel the mysteries of the world.
She is completely subservient to Yukari, taking care of most of her duties and acting in her stead while she hibernates. She can be found anywhere that her duties take her. She's typically a reasonable and peaceful person, unless it comes to protecting Yukari or Chen.

- ***Kingdom-Toppling Presence:***
The legendary nine-tailed foxes are known for their enchanting beauty and cunning intelligence, capable of influencing creatures and altering the fate of nations. Ran embodies this myth, possessing an allure and persuasive power that can sway the hearts and minds of others on a grand scale. As an action, she can choose one effect from below:
    - ***Alluring Aura:*** Ran exudes an enchanting aura that captivates those around her. Gaining advantage on all Charisma checks when interacting with creatures. Male humanoids within 15 ft. must take a Wisdom saving throw (DC=8 + her proficiency bonus + her Charisma modifier) or be charmed immediately for an hour. Charmed creature may make a Wisdom saving throw once every minute and whenever you deal damage to it. On a success, the charm effect ends. Ran can use this ability 5 times before a long rest.
    - ***Charm of the Nine Tails:*** Ran can employ her mystical charm to bend others to her will. The effect is equivalent to a mass suggestion spell casted at 7th-level but without expending a spell slot or requiring components. The spell save DC is 8 + her proficiency bonus + her Charisma modifier. Targets charmed by this ability are unaware they were charmed after the effect ends. She regains the ability to
    use this feature in this way after finishing a short or long rest.
    - ***Enchanting Majesty:*** The sheer force of Ran's presence can overwhelm the senses of those who oppose her. She forces all creatures of her choice within a 60-foot radius who can sense her presence to make a Wisdom saving throw against her spell save DC, or becomes charmed or frightened (Ran's choice) for 1 minute. Target may reroll the save at the end of each of its rounds, ending the effect on a success. She can use this feature three times, regaining all uses after a long rest.

Creatures with an Intelligence score of 6 or lower or those who cannot be charmed are immune to these effects.

- ***Shikigami Possession:***
As powerful as Ran is, she is ultimately subservient to a more powerful master, Yukari Yakumo, and can be lent some of her master's power when required. If Yukari is on the same plane as Ran, she can empower Ran as a bonus action. Whilst empowered this way, Ran gains +3 to her AC, +4 to her spell attack rolls, +4 to her spell save DC, an additional 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th level spell slot. She may use *Shikigami - Protection of Zenki and Goki*. She automatically rerolls all damage dice that are below average.

### Actions

***Claw:*** Melee weapon attack. +11 to hit, 2d8+5 slashing damage, 3d6 fire damage.

***Shikigami - Chen:*** Ran summons Chen to a point within 120 ft. of herself. She may then have Chen be immediately empowered and activate her *Shikigami Possession* feature.

***Shikigami - Protection of Zenki and Goki:*** May only be used when empowered by Yukari activating her Shikigami Possession feature. Ran summons Zenki and Goki, Yukari's familiars, to a point within 60 ft. of herself.

***Empower Chen:*** If Chen is within 120 ft. of Ran, Ran may empower Chen and activating Chen's *Shikigami Possession* feature.

### **Legendary Actions**
Ran Yakumo can take **9** legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.
- ***Nine-Tailed Sorcery***: Ran casts a spell of up to 9 level that has a casting time of 1 action as if casting in her round, spending the legendary action that equivalent to the spell level. For example, casting a fireball costs 3 legendary actions.
- ***Tail Bind:*** Ran uses her magical tails to bind a creature she can see within 60 feet. She can spend 1 or more legendary actions up to 4 to perform this action. For each legendary action spent, she uses an additional tail to strengthen the binding. The target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 8 + Ran's proficiency bonus + number of tails used. On a failed save, the target becomes grappled and restrained by Ran's tails. While restrained, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage for each tail involved at the start of its round. To maintaining the bind, Ran's maximum legendary actions per round are reduced by the number of tails used, she regains these actions when the bind ends. She may change number of tails used to bind the target at start of her round (no action cost), the DC and damage are changed align with number of tails using. The restrained creature can use its action to attempt breaking free by repeating the saving throw. She can use this action on one creature at a time.
- ***Tail Wallop:*** Ran makes a melee weapon attack using one of her tails against a target within 15 feet. She can spend additional legendary actions to strengthen the attack. This melee attack has +16 to hit and 1d10 + 6 bludgeoning damage, she can use additional tails with maximum of 5 to increasing the damage by 1d10 per each up to 5d10+6, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw with DC 16 + number of tails used (up to 21), or be knocked prone.
- ***Tail Shield:*** Ran wraps her tails around herself or an ally within 5 feet, granting a +1 bonus to AC for each legendary action spent up to 5 until the start of her next turn. This action can be used only once per round.
