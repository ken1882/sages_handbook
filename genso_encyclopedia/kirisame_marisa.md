# Kirisame Marisa
Marisa is a free-spirited Human girl. She has a love for astronomy and spells, and believes the firepower of magic is first priority. So she often prefers a frontal or brute-force approach to her problems - if a laser won't burn a hole through it, make a bigger laser.

However, behind this spectacle and seemingly straightforward approach lies a mind of great intelligence and cunning. Her greatest strength is that she's constantly improving and learning, fuelled by her close rivalry with Reimu Hakurei, and she is yet to fall behind.

Aside from her rivalry with Reimu, her brash but friendly personality allows her to easily befriend others. Not only does she often work closely with other magicians such as Alice Margatroid and Patchouli Knowledge, but also with scientists like Nitori Kawashiro, and she can even get along well with fairies, who are often poorly understood

### Traits

- ***Dual Casting: (3/day, Recharge 5-6):*** When Marisa casts a spell, after choosing the area/targets of the spell but before resolving the effects of that spell, she may cast another spell. Determine the area/targets of the second spell, then resolve the effects of the first spell, followed by the second spell. If the first spell is countered or otherwise nullified, she may still cast another spell.

- ***Maximum Output:*** When Marisa rolls damage for one of her spells, she may re-roll any dice that roll a 1 or 2.

- ***Mini-Hakkero:*** A small, octagonal device that acts as a portable means of casting spells. The mini-Hakkero counts as an arcane focus and grants +2 to hit for her spells. It allows Marisa to cast spells without needing somatic or material components. However, if she has the material components to cast a spell, she can use them to charge the mini-Hakkero. Doing this causes the spell to neither consume nor require a spell slot to cast.

- ***Spellthief:*** Marisa is an accomplished magician who is able to discern the method behind any spell, and attempt to replicate it. If Marisa sees a spell being cast, or sees its effects, she remembers it. She can spend three days of experimentation to research that spell. At the end of those three days, she learns the spell, and can cast it if she meets the requirements.<br> She can also attempt to replicate spell-related features this way, such as a Sorcerer's Metamagic or a Warlock's Agonizing Blast. She finds some way to replicate the effects of the feature without needing to be of that class; she does not need to form a pact to learn Warlock features, for example, but instead finds an alternate way to create the same effect. <br> She can also attempt to create a new spell based off of spells she already knows. The amount of time needed for experimentation for a new spell is up to the DM, and may require assistance from other magicians.

### Actions

- ***Multiattack:*** Marisa makes two attacks with Illusion Laser, and three with Magik Missiles. Alternatively, she may cast a spell and attack twice with Illusion Laser. In either case, both Illusion Laser attacks must be against the same target.

- ***Magik Missiles:*** Ranged spell attack. 120 ft. range, +14 to hit, 3d8+8 force damage.

### Roleplaying Notes
- **Personality Traits:** Marisa Kirisame is energetic, confident, and somewhat mischievous. She's fiercely independent, often acting on her own whims without much regard for rules or authority. Marisa is curious and adventurous, always seeking new knowledge and magical artifacts. She has a habit of borrowing (often without permission) items that pique her interest, justifying it as "necessary for research."
- **Ideals:** Marisa is driven by her desire to become the greatest magician in Gensokyo. She values knowledge, power, and personal growth. Her ambition pushes her to constantly improve her magical abilities, often experimenting with new spells and techniques.
- **Bonds:** Marisa has a friendly rivalry with Reimu Hakurei, the shrine maiden of Gensokyo. Despite their contrasting personalities, they often work together to resolve incidents. She is also connected to other magicians like Patchouli Knowledge and Alice Margatroid, sometimes collaborating or competing with them. Marisa has a deep connection to her home, Kirisame Magic Shop inside the Forest of Magic, where she resides, conducts her experiments and offer services.
- **Flaws:** Marisa's overconfidence can lead her into trouble, underestimating dangers or overestimating her abilities. Her tendency to "borrow" things without asking can strain relationships and cause conflicts. Additionally, she can be stubborn, refusing to accept help or advice even when it's in her best interest.


### Tactics
In combat, Marisa favors overwhelming offense, using powerful magic to blast her opponents. She specializes in high-damage, wide-area spells, often employing flashy and explosive attacks. Marisa relies heavily on her signature moves like "Master Spark" a massive beam of concentrated magic energy.

She prefers to keep her distance, flying on her broomstick to stay mobile and out of reach. Marisa is not above using tricks or unconventional methods to gain an advantage, such as using illusionary spells or environmental manipulation. Her combat style is aggressive and daring, reflecting her bold personality.

Marisa often exploits her deep knowledge of magic items and potions, incorporating them into her strategies. She may use enchanted mushrooms, magical seals, or other artifacts to augment her abilities or hinder her opponents.


## Lore
Marisa Kirisame is a human magician living in the Forest of Magic. She is one of the most prominent figures in Gensokyo and frequently involved in resolving incidents alongside Reimu Hakurei. Unlike other magicians who may have innate magical abilities, Marisa is entirely self-taught, relying on hard work and relentless study to hone her craft.

Her home in the Forest of Magic, also known as Kirisame Magic Shop, is filled with books, artifacts, and ingredients gathered from various places, some of which she "borrowed" from others, and the interior is so unimaginably disordered that it becomes like a mini-Forest of Magic.

Marisa is known for her optimistic outlook and determination. Her belief that hard work can surpass natural talent is a central aspect of her character. She often pushes herself to the limits to achieve her goals, embodying the idea that humans can hold their own among the youkai of Gensokyo. But her relentless pursuit of magical knowledge often leads her to interact with other powerful beings, either learning from them or competing against them.

Despite her occasional mischief and rule-bending, Marisa is generally well-liked and maintains friendly relationships with many characters. Her dynamic with Reimu is particularly noteworthy; they often collaborate to maintain peace in Gensokyo, balancing each other's strengths and weaknesses.

### Adventure Hooks
Marisa is suitable for basically anything except antagonist due to her nature of basically being everywhere. She can even sell goods to player party thanks to her hoarding inside her home. But also due to her nature, if player party was misidentified as youkai by Marisa, there's very high chance to cause a wipe by one single Master Spark (even though combats inside Gensokyo even not Danmaku Duel should considered non-lethal).

> ##### Author's Notes
> As the deuteragonist of the Touhou Series and often compete with Reimu in the top one popularity poll, Marisa also comes with a lot of different settings and stories, even personalities portrayed in various creations. She might be considered annoying, but sometimes could be helpful to the play due to her high motivations.
