# Kirisame Marisa
Marisa is a free-spirited Human girl. She has a love for astronomy, and believes the firepower of magic is first priority. So she often prefers a frontal or brute-force approach to her problems - if a laser won't burn a hole through it, make a bigger laser.

However, behind this spectacle and seemingly straightforward approach lies a mind of great intelligence and cunning. Her greatest strength is that she's constantly improving and learning, fuelled by her close rivalry with Reimu Hakurei, and she is yet to fall behind.

Aside from her rivalry with Reimu, her brash but friendly personality allows her to easily befriend others. Not only does she often work closely with other magicians such as Alice Margatroid and Patchouli Knowledge, but also with scientists like Nitori Kawashiro, and she can even get along well with fairies, who are often poorly understood

### Traits

- ***Dual Casting: (3/day, Recharge 5-6):*** When Marisa casts a spell, after choosing the area/targets of the spell but before resolving the effects of that spell, she may cast another spell. Determine the area/targets of the second spell, then resolve the effects of the first spell, followed by the second spell. If the first spell is countered or otherwise nullified, she may still cast another spell.

- ***Maximum Output:*** When Marisa rolls damage for one of her spells, she may re-roll any dice that roll a 1 or 2.

- ***Mini-Hakkero:*** A small, octagonal device that acts as a portable means of casting spells. The mini-Hakkero counts as an arcane focus and grants +2 to hit for her spells. It allows Marisa to cast spells without needing somatic or material components. However, if she has the material components to cast a spell, she can use them to charge the mini-Hakkero. Doing this causes the spell to neither consume nor require a spell slot to cast.

- ***Spellthief:*** Marisa is an accomplished magician who is able to discern the method behind any spell, and attempt to replicate it. If Marisa sees a spell being cast, or sees its effects, she remembers it. She can spend three days of experimentation to research that spell. At the end of those three days, she learns the spell, and can cast it if she meets the requirements.<br> She can also attempt to replicate spell-related features this way, such as a Sorcerer's Metamagic or a Warlock's Agonizing Blast. She finds some way to replicate the effects of the feature without needing to be of that class; she does not need to form a pact to learn Warlock features, for example, but instead finds an alternate way to create the same effect. <br> She can also attempt to create a new spell based off of spells she already knows. The amount of time needed for experimentation for a new spell is up to the DM, and may require assistance from other magicians.

- ***Multiattack:*** Marisa makes two attacks with Illusion Laser, and three with Magic Missiles. Alternatively, she may cast a spell and attack twice with Illusion Laser. In either case, both Illusion Laser attacks must be against the same target.

- ***Magic Missiles:*** Ranged spell attack. 120 ft. range, +14 to hit, 3d8+8 force damage.


### Reactions

Marisa creates a magic-absorbing field that lasts until the beginning of her next round. This field acts as 10th-level spell *Spell Trap* with 15 points of protection level.

### Spells
#### Magic Sign "Stardust Reverie"
*4th level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S, M (Magical mushrooms)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

One of Marisa's favorable opening spell, she quickly creates and rapidly shooting magical projectiles with shape of stars to a direction she chooses, creatures within the cone area must take a Dexterity Saving throw of DC 14 or inflicted with 6d6 force damage, a successful check halves the damage.

#### Light Blast "Shoot the Moon"
*5th level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (Magical mushrooms)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel arcane energy into the ground, erupting powerful beams of radiant light from below to the sky. Choose a point within range. From that point, beams of light shoot upward in a 30-foot-radius area, each one 10 feet wide. Each creature within this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 radiant damage and 4d6 force damage and is knocked 15 feet into the air by the force of the ascending light, when the spell ends and having no countermeasures such as flying or slow falling, the creature takes fall damage and falling prone until start of its next round. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked into the air.

The ascending beams scorch the ground and leave shimmering trails of light that linger momentarily, illuminating the surrounding 60 feet in bright light and an additional 60 feet in dim light.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, both radiant and force damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
