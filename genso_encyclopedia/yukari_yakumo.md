# Yukari Yakumo
Yukari Yakumo is a legendary youkai who is able to manipulate boundaries. She is the master of Ran Yakumo. She is called the "gap youkai", although "gap youkai" is not the name of a species, as she is more of a one-of-a-kind type of youkai. Regardless of her power, Yukari appears to be the most well-informed being in Gensokyo of any kind and usually achieves her goals through manipulating events rather than direct combat.

Alias: Mastermind Behind the Spiriting Away, Border of Phantasm, Youkai that lurks in the boundary, Youkai of Boundaries, Border of Fantasy, Uncanny Smile, Phantasmal Foxes' Wedding, Sunshower of Fantasy, Youkai Who Comes and Goes As She Pleases, Gatekeeper of Gensokyo, Elusive and Two-Faced Youkai, Border of Investigator and Instigator, Gensokyo's Fixer.

### Traits

- ***Bounded Field:***
As a bonus action, Yukari creates a 120 ft. cube. This cube lasts until she is reduced to 0 hit points or she dismisses it.

Yukari may take up to 3 reactions per round instead of 1. She can never be surprised.

Yukari is immune to spells and effects that only target living creatures, as well as those that only affect dead or undead creatures. She cannot die by any means short of the destruction of the multiverse.

- ***No Sell:***
Yukari is immune to the effects of spells cast at 9th level or below, unless she chooses otherwise.

- ***Legendary Resistance (5/day):***
Whenever Yukari fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

- ***Redirection:***
When an attack roll or Dexterity saving throw is made against a creature that Yukari is aware of, she can use a reaction to reroll. She may do this after the outcome of the original roll is known.

- ***Youkai of Boundaries:***
Yukari is aware whenever a creature enters or leaves her current plane of existence.

### Epic Spells
#### Spell Trap
*10th level Abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You create a barrier of magical protection around yourself. Every spell directly cast at you is absorbed by spell trap - making you recall a previously cast spell of up to that level. The incoming spell has no other effect on you. Spell trap can absorb any spell up to 9th level.

Spell trap absorbs a total of 1 spell level per your caster level, before ending. The protection spell trap provides is absolute: having 1 level remaining of this protection means a 1st level or a 9th level spell is be absorbed, though the spell slot you regain matches only the spell levels remaining of spell trap.

Mordenkainen/Mage's Disjunction may end this spell, if you are within that spell's area and its caster succeeds on the spell check. Each turn you are within the area of effect of Disjunction, its caster can attempt the spell check on its turn.

You can dismiss spell trap as a bonus action.


#### Dweomerdoom
*10th level Abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, when you see a spell being cast

**Range:** Within sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You counterspell an opponent's spell or spell-like ability before it is even cast and without knowing what spell you are countering. If counterspelling a spell above 10th level, make a contested Intelligence check.


#### Reality Shift
*10th level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 round

**Range:** See text

**Components:** V, S, M (pieces of shattered glasses and gems worth at least 100,000 gp)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You momentarily alters the laws of reality in a 500-ft. cube around you, changing the environment, warping terrain, and altering natural laws. Gravity may shift, time may slow down or speed up, or objects within the area may be teleported randomly. Any teleportation attempt besides you made in the area must take a spell check in order to proceed. Creatures in the area subjected to one of the following effects according to their d4 roll each minute as long as they're still inside the area of effect:

\page

1. Gravity Shift: The creature must take a DC 26 Strength saving throw or be thrown in a random direction, taking 10d10 force damage and becoming stunned for next 2 rounds.
2. Temporal Displacement: The creature must take a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw or is trapped in a temporal anomaly, disappearing from the timeline for 1d6 rounds, reappearing where they were.
3. Spatial Warp: The creature must take a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw is teleported to a random location within 1 mile, suffering 10d10 psychic damage due to disorientation.
4. Distorted Time: The creature must take a DC 26 Intelligence saving throw or be slowed, freedom of movement does not save target from the effect since it was slowed by time factors.

The spell effect persists even the caster leaves the area, leaving the place completely chaotic scattered aftermath.

#### Boundary of Life and Death
*11th level Divination/Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** See text

**Components:** V, S, M (See text)

**Duration:** See text

You manipulate the boundary between life and death. Causing one effect of your choosing:
1. As an action, you target up to 5 creatures within 100 ft. and force them to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the creature's destiny is shifted to the boundary of death, becoming unable to heal or be resurrected for the duration of 10 minutes. Any healing effects applied to the creature fail. At the end of each of its rounds, the creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points while affected by this spell, its soul is bound to the boundary of death and cannot be revived by any means short of a Wish spell cast with a 10th-level slot.
2. When you recognize a creature's hit points reach 0, you can cast this spell as a reaction to undo its death by shifting the boundary of life and death, returning it to the moment before it was killed, fully restored to life with all hit points. The creature's death and any associated events, such as its wounds, poison, diseases, and curses, are fully erased from time, as if they never occurred.
3. You consume a petal from Saigyou Ayakashi's cherry blossom tree and open up the boundaries to search for a creature's soul - either fallen or alive. If the creature is dead, you restore it to life as per the True Resurrection spell, even if the soul is unwilling, trapped, or destroyed. If the creature is alive but its soul or body is trapped, you forcibly retrieve the soul or body, reuniting them at a location you choose within 100 feet of you. This effect cross planes and bypasses any barriers, wards, or spells that prevent resurrection or retrieval, including spells like imprisonment or trap the soul. The creature is restored to full health, and any conditions preventing its return are nullified, and ignores the normal limitations of resurrection spells, such as time since death or the condition of its soul or body. The casting time of this effect is 1 minute, then you must stay concentration to search for your target, for every minute, you trace back 1 year since the creature's demise or expand the spell's scan radius by 1,000 kilometers or cross into another plane of existence, the spell is wasted if you didn't manage to find the target within a day.


#### Boundary of Space and Time
*11th level Conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** within sight

**Components:** V, S, M (a magical landscape map crafted from rare materials, see text)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You opens a gap into the magical map that have drawn, a plane of existence that reflects the boundaries of the world within the artist's creation. This map can take the form of a sprawling city, uncanny landscapes, dangerous labyrinth, or any other scenery one can imagine. All creatures within maximum of 1-mile radius are teleported into this dimension unless they succeed on an Wisdom saving throw. While inside, creatures can only move in this domain, a reflection of the creator's will existing as a pocket dimension, isolated from the rest of the multiverse, and time seems to flow differently, for each hour that passes inside, only 1 minute passes outside. Creatures within are trapped indefinitely, Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target. Nothing can pass through the boundary, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. To leave the dimension, a dispel magic spell can save the victim only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting a creature inside and close to (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster level) the special component used to create it. Or the caster cast the spell with same component again opening the boundary.
If the component is destroyed or dispelled by the Disjunction, all creatures inside immediately free from the dimension.

To craft the component, following materials from various location must be used:
- 1 pound of high quality sand without impurities.
- 10 pounds of imperial jade from Youkai Mountain and filled with beasts spiritual power.
- 3 vials (6 ounces) of sacred water blessed by a miko with unparalleled exorcism power, each vial is capable of dealing no less than 50 hit points of radiant damage on average roll when applied to evil being. (for instance, average roll of 10d10 is (1+10)/2*10=55)
- 50 feet of silk thread imbued with the essence of the moon and longevity.
- 5 pounds of infernal bloodstone formed by agglomerate the residue from boiling the bloods of evils repetitively.
- 1 stellar feather of Yatagarasu.
- 80 pounds of keystone.
- 10 plants of Untainted Lotus.
- 4 gallons of underground water from Forest of Magic.
- 8 pounds of cotton, grew in Garden of the Sun and fertilized with bonemeal made from creatures has average DC above 10.
- Crafting process unknown

#### Boundary Collapse
*12th level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1,000 ft.

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of collapsed star)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You collapses the boundaries between dimensions, creating a singularity black hole that pulls everything toward it and warps space-time itself. The black hole manifests at a point within range of your choosing and the closer creatures or objects are to it, the more violently they are affected by its pull. The singularity grows over time, threatening to consume anything near it.

Once the singularity is created, all creatures and objects within its radius are affected by its gravitational pull. Creatures must make progressively harder saving throws the closer they are to the singularity, listed as follows:

- ***Within 100 ft.:***
All creatures and objects within 100 feet must make a DC 30 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their round or be pulled 50 feet toward the center and take 20d12 force damage. On a success, they are not pulled but still take half damage. If pulled into the center, they are instantly crushed and reducing to atoms, cannot be resurrected without spell of 10th-level or above. All movement speed are reduced to one tenth, teleportation unconditionally fails.

- ***101-300 ft.:***
All creatures and objects must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their rounds or be pulled 30 feet toward the center and take 10d12 force damage. On a success, they are not pulled but still take half damage. All movement speed are halved, teleportation unconditionally fails.

- ***301-500 ft.:***
All creatures and objects must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their rounds or be pulled 20 feet toward the center and take 5d12 force damage. On a success, they are not pulled but still take half damage. Teleportation attempts must make a DC 25 Constitution check to proceed.

- ***501-1000 ft.:***
All creatures and objects must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their rounds or be pulled 10 feet toward the center, they are not pulled on a success.

After each round, the black hole's pull grows stronger, expands the size of affected area by 100 feet (starting at 1 ft.) and reaches maximum radius of 1000 feet after 10 rounds, creatures within 500 feet must make another DC 20 Wisdom saving throw every round or suffer from space-time distortion, causing them to be randomly displaced by 2d10 feet in any direction and experiencing time dilation, losing their action for the round.

You can end the spell at will, causing the singularity to collapse into nothingness. However, if the singularity is allowed to remain for the full duration, it may become unstable and expand uncontrollably, leading to catastrophic consequences.

While casting this spell, you're completely immune to its effects.


### Boundary of Realities (Ritual)
*12th level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** See text

**Range:** See text

**Components:** V, S, M (a writing brush of infinite possibilities and a parchment of void mortality)

**Duration:** See text

You briefly rewrites the rules of reality in your immediate vicinity. You alter the fundamental laws of physics and magic inside your plane of existence. You can choose up to three effects, such as:

- Gravity is reversed, allowing creatures to walk on walls or ceilings.
- Magic becomes unstable, causing all spells cast within the area to require a DC 20 spellcasting check or fail.
- Time flows differently, slowing or hastening creatures' actions.
- Healing effects are reversed, causing healing magic to deal damage instead.
- Blur the boundaries between planes, allowing creatures to be partially in one plane and another, causing unpredictable effects.
- Objects and creatures in the area may randomly teleport short distances, making movement unreliable.

You can specify the area and duration for the effects, greater area and longer duration requires longer casting time according to the following table, multiply the time required to the number of effects will be the final casting time:

| Dur./AOE | ~100ft. | 101~500 ft. | 501~1000 ft. | 1000~3000 ft. | Current Plane |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 hour  | 1 minute | 10 minutes | 1 hour | 6 hours | 1 day |
| 1 day | 10 minutes | 1 hour | 6 hours | 12 hours | 3 days |
| 1 week | 30 minutes | 3 hours | 12 hours | 1 day | 1 month |
| 1 month | 6 hours | 1 day | 5 days | 12 days | 6 months |
| 1 year | 1 day | 6 days | 1 month | 3 months | 7 years |
| Permanent | 1 week | 1 month | 1 year | 10 years | 1000 years |

As soon as the ritual begins, the deities linked to the rules you have written instantly notice your casting attempt to disrupt their authority.

### Tactics
In combat, Yukari rarely engages directly unless necessary. She prefers to manipulate the battlefield using her mastery over boundaries, or summon her shikigami fight for her. If a direct conflict is inevitable, she'll propose a Danmaku duel rather than bloodshed. In any case she needs to demonstrate her power, Yukari approaches combat with a calm demeanor, always appearing one step ahead. She views battles as a game of chess, strategically positioning herself and others to achieve victory with minimal effort.

### Roleplaying Notes
- **Personality Traits:** Yukari Yakumo is enigmatic and whimsical, often appearing aloof or detached. She enjoys teasing and manipulating others for her own amusement, but beneath her playful exterior lies a keen intellect and deep wisdom. She is highly observant, strategic, and has a penchant for meddling in events from the shadows.
- **Ideals:** Yukari is driven by the desire to maintain balance and stability within Gensokyo. She values the preservation of boundaries between realms, concepts, and even life and death. Her actions are often guided by a long-term vision for the well-being of Gensokyo, even if her methods seem inscrutable to others.
- **Bonds:** She shares a close bond with her shikigami, Ran Yakumo. Through Ran, she is also connected to Chen, Ran's own shikigami. Yukari has complex relationships with other powerful beings in Gensokyo, such as Yuyuko Saigyouji and Miko of Hakurei.
- **Flaws:** Her enigmatic nature can lead to misunderstandings, causing others to distrust her motives. Yukari's tendency to manipulate situations without informing those involved can create unintended consequences. Also, since she spents most of her time sleeping, her source of information and errands relies heavily on her shikigami.

## Lore
Yukari Yakumo, despite often claiming she's age 17, is one of the oldest and most powerful youkai in Gensokyo, known as the Gap Youkai. She possesses the ability to manipulate boundaries, but this ability is rarely seen used other than for opening gaps to teleport around Gensokyo and fixing the barrier. Still, this mysterious power and her extraordinary wisdom make her a key figure in maintaining the balance and isolation of Gensokyo from the outside world.

Yukari played a crucial role in the creation of the Great Hakurei Barrier, which separates Gensokyo from the outside world. This event is often seen as the origin of Gensokyo, and those involved are called the Sages of Gensokyo. She often spends long periods sleeping, leaving the management of day-to-day affairs to her shikigami, Ran. Despite her apparent laziness, she is highly influential and keeps a watchful eye on the incidents that could threaten the stability of Gensokyo.

She enjoys mentoring and challenging younger youkai and humans alike, sometimes acting as an antagonist to spur growth in others. Yukari's true intentions are rarely clear, and she often operates behind the scenes, nudging events in directions that serve her inscrutable purposes.

Her interactions with other characters are complex. Two of her most notable backstories are that she seems to know the secret of the Saigyou Ayakashi and Yuyuko Saigyouji, and that she started two Lunar Wars against the Lunarians. But her true intentions perhaps only lie in the deepest parts of the gap that is accessible only by Yukari herself.

### Adventure Hooks
In a campaign or adventure, she is very likely the mastermind behind the scenes, manipulating the progression of events. Unless you're replaying the second Lunar War, which she goes on the expedition herself, which is very rare and perhaps the only one she risks herself to win the game.

> ##### Author's Notes
> Yukari Yakumo is arguably one of the most complex characters in the Touhou Project. Her mysterious nature often leads to varying interpretations; feel free to modify any aspects to suit your playthrough. The sections about her backstory with Yuyuko Saigyouji and the Lunar War are kept spoiler-free. These stories are detailed in ***Perfect Cherry Blossom*** and ***Silent Sinner in Blue***, respectively. It is highly recommended that you read them yourself for a deeper understanding.
