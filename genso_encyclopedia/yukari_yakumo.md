# Yukari Yakumo
Yukari Yakumo is a legendary youkai who is able to manipulate boundaries. She is the master of Ran Yakumo. She is called the "gap youkai", although "gap youkai" is not the name of a species, as she is more of a one-of-a-kind type of youkai. Regardless of her power, Yukari appears to be the most well-informed being in Gensokyo of any kind and usually achieves her goals through manipulating events rather than direct combat.

### Traits

***Bounded Field:***
As a bonus action, Yukari creates a 120 ft. cube. This cube lasts until she is reduced to 0 hit points or she dismisses it. Creatures inside cannot pass through its boundaries, and teleportation or planar travel redirects the creature to the closest edge of the cube. Yukari can allow creatures to pass through the boundary at her discretion. She can use this ability 5 times before a long rest.

***Eyes of Laplace:***
Yukari may take up to 3 reactions per round instead of 1. She can never be surprised.

***Necrofantasia:***
Yukari is immune to spells and effects that only target living creatures, as well as those that only affect dead or undead creatures. She cannot die by any means short of the destruction of the multiverse.

***No Sell:***
Yukari is immune to the effects of spells cast at 9th level or below, unless she chooses otherwise.

***Legendary Resistance (5/day):***
Whenever Yukari fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Redirection:***
When an attack roll or Dexterity saving throw is made against a creature that Yukari is aware of, she can use a reaction to reroll. She may do this after the outcome of the original roll is known.

***Youkai of Boundaries:***
Yukari is aware whenever a creature enters or leaves her current plane of existence.

### Epic Spells
#### Spell Trap
*10th level Abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You create a barrier of magical protection around yourself. Every spell directly cast at you is absorbed by spell trap – making you recall a previously cast spell of up to that level. The incoming spell has no other effect on you. Spell trap can absorb any spell up to 9th level.

Spell trap absorbs a total of 1 spell level per your caster level, before ending. The protection spell trap provides is absolute: having 1 level remaining of this protection means a 1st level or a 9th level spell is be absorbed, though the spell slot you regain matches only the spell levels remaining of spell trap.

Mordenkainen/Mage's Disjunction may end this spell, if you are within that spell’s area and its caster succeeds on the spell check. Each turn you are within the area of effect of Disjunction, its caster can attempt the spell check on its turn.

You can dismiss spell trap as a bonus action.


#### Dweomerdoom
*10th level Abjuration*

**Casting Time:**1 reaction, when you see a spell being cast

**Range:** Within sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You counterspell an opponent's spell or spell-like ability before it is even cast and without knowing what spell you are countering. If counterspelling a spell above 10th level, make a contested Intelligence check.


#### Reality Shift
*10th level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 round

**Range:** See text

**Components:** V, S, M (pieces of shattered glasses and gems worth at least 100,000 gp)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You momentarily alters the laws of reality in a 500-ft. cube around you, changing the environment, warping terrain, and altering natural laws. Gravity may shift, time may slow down or speed up, or objects within the area may be teleported randomly. Any teleportation attempt besides you made in the area must take a spell check in order to proceed. Creatures in the area subjected to one of the following effects according to their d4 roll each minute as long as they're still inside the area of effect:

\page

1. Gravity Shift: The creature must take a DC 26 Strength saving throw or be thrown in a random direction, taking 10d10 force damage and becoming stunned for next 2 rounds.
2. Temporal Displacement: The creature must take a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw or is trapped in a temporal anomaly, disappearing from the timeline for 1d6 rounds, reappearing where they were.
3. Spatial Warp: The creature must take a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw is teleported to a random location within 1 mile, suffering 10d10 psychic damage due to disorientation.
4. Distorted Time: The creature must take a DC 26 Intelligence saving throw or is slowed, freedom of movement does not save target from the effect.

The spell effect persists even the caster leaves the area, leaving the place completely chaotic scattered aftermath.

#### Boundary of Life and Death
*11th level Divination/Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** See text

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You manipulates the boundary between life and death. Causing one effect of your choosing:
1. Targeting up to 5 creatures within 100 ft. and forces target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is shifted to the boundary of life and death, becoming unable to heal or be resurrected for the duration. Any healing effects applied to the creature fail. At the end of each of its round, the creature takes 8d12 necrotic damage. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points while affected by this spell, it cannot be revived by any means short of a Wish spell.
2. Reversing the life of a fallen creature. As long as the target's demise is within 3 days, you can cast this spell to undo its death, returning it to the moment before it was killed, fully restored to life with all hit points. The creature’s death and any associated events are erased from time, as if they never occurred. After choosing this effect, Yukari cannot use this spell again for 7 days.

#### Boundary of Space and Time
*11th level Conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** within sight

**Components:** V, S, M (a magical labyrinthine map crafted with materials at least worth total of 1,000,000 gp)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You opens a gap into an infinite labyrinth, a spatial loop that traps creatures within an endless pathway. All creatures within maximum of 1-mile radius are teleported into this dimension unless they succeed on an Wisdom saving throw. While inside, creatures can only move through a series of hallways that repeat endlessly, and time seems to flow differently. For each hour that passes inside the labyrinth, only 1 minute passes outside. Creatures inside the labyrinth are trapped indefinitely, Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target. Nothing can pass through the boundary, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. To leave the labyrinth, a dispel magic spell can save the victim only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell (or higher), targeting a creature inside and close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster level) to the special component used to create it. Or the caster cast the spell with same component again opening the boundary.
If the component is destroyed or dispelled by the Disjunction, all creatures inside immediately free from the labyrinth.


#### Boundary Collapse
*12th level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1,000 ft.

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of collapsed star)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You collapses the boundaries between dimensions, creating a singularity black hole that pulls everything toward it and warps space-time itself. The black hole manifests at a point within range of your choosing and the closer creatures or objects are to it, the more violently they are affected by its pull. The singularity grows over time, threatening to consume anything near it.

Once the singularity is created, all creatures and objects within its radius are affected by its gravitational pull. Creatures must make progressively harder saving throws the closer they are to the singularity, listed as follows:

\page

- ***Within 100 ft.:***
All creatures and objects within 100 feet must make a DC 30 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their round or be pulled 50 feet toward the center and take 20d12 force damage. On a success, they are not pulled but still take half damage. If pulled into the center, they are instantly crushed and reducing to atoms, cannot be resurrected without divine intervention. All movement speed are reduced to one tenth, teleportation unconditionally fails.

- ***101-300 ft.:***
All creatures and objects must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their rounds or be pulled 30 feet toward the center and take 10d12 force damage. On a success, they are not pulled but still take half damage. All movement speed are halved, teleportation unconditionally fails.

- ***301-500 ft.:***
All creatures and objects must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their rounds or be pulled 20 feet toward the center and take 5d12 force damage. On a success, they are not pulled but still take half damage. Teleportation attempts must make a DC 25 Constitution check to proceed.

- ***501-1000 ft. away:***
All creatures and objects must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw at the start of each of their rounds or be pulled 10 feet toward the center, they are not pulled on a success.

After each round, the black hole's pull grows stronger, expands the size of affected area by 10 feet (starting at 1 ft.), creatures within 500 feet must make another DC 20 Wisdom saving throw every round or suffer from space-time distortion, causing them to be randomly displaced by 2d10 feet in any direction and experiencing time dilation, losing their action for the round.

You can end the spell at will, causing the singularity to collapse into nothingness. However, if the singularity is allowed to remain for the full duration, it may become unstable and expand uncontrollably, leading to catastrophic consequences.

While casting this spell, you're completely immune to its effects.


### Boundary of Realities (Ritual)
*12th level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** See text

**Range:** See text

**Components:** V, S, M (a writing brush of infinite possibilities and a parchment of void mortality)

**Duration:** See text

You briefly rewrites the rules of reality in your immediate vicinity. You alter the fundamental laws of physics and magic inside your plane of existence. You can choose up to three effects, such as:
    - Gravity is reversed, allowing creatures to walk on walls or ceilings.
    - Magic becomes unstable, causing all spells cast within the area to require a DC 20 spellcasting check or fail.
    - Time flows differently, slowing or hastening creatures’ actions.
    - Healing effects are reversed, causing healing magic to deal damage instead.
You can specify the area and duration for the effects, greater area and longer duration requires longer casting time according to the following table, multiply the time required to the effects will be the final casting time:

| Dur./AOE | ~100ft. | 101~500 ft. | 501~1000 ft. | 1000~3000 ft. | Current Plane |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 hour  | 1 minute | 10 minutes | 1 hour | 6 hours | 1 day |
| 1 day | 10 minutes | 1 hour | 6 hours | 12 hours | 3 days |
| 1 week | 30 minutes | 3 hours | 12 hours | 1 day | 1 month |
| 1 month | 6 hours | 1 day | 5 days | 12 days | 6 months |
| 1 year | 1 day | 6 days | 1 month | 3 months | 7 years |
| Permanent | 1 week | 1 month | 1 year | 10 years | 1000 years |

Once upon the ritual starts, deities related to the rules you written immediately notices your casting attempt.
