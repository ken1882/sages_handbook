### Roleplaying Notes
- **Personality Traits:** Reimu is diligent yet unmotivated when it comes to her shrine duties. She often appears nonchalant or even lazy, especially regarding shrine upkeep. However, she has a deep sense of responsibility toward Gensokyo's balance and will spring into action whenever a real incident arises. She's practical, preferring direct action and straightforward solutions.
- **Ideals:** Reimu, as a miko of Hakurei, is driven by a sense of duty, as she believes that preserving harmony between humans and youkai in Gensokyo is essential. She has an instinctive dislike for overly complex plans, valuing simplicity and efficiency. Her moral code is firm but flexible, focusing on protecting both worlds while ensuring peace.
- **Bonds:** Reimu is deeply connected to the Hakurei Shrine and feels a special bond with Gensokyo itself. She also maintains various connections with prominent individuals in Gensokyo, including Yukari Yakumo, Marisa Kirisame, and various residents in Gensokyo. While she may express frustration at being dragged into conflicts, she feels a genuine, albeit reluctant, camaraderie with her allies.
- **Flaws:** Reimu's overconfidence in her abilities sometimes leads her to underestimate threats. She can be dismissive, which causes tension with others, especially with those who do not understand her direct and often blunt nature. Additionally, her pragmatism can be mistaken for aloofness, leading some to question her empathy or commitment.


## Lore
Reimu Hakurei is a shrine maiden of the Hakurei bloodline, an ancient lineage charged with protecting Gensokyo's Hakurei Border and maintaining the balance between humans and youkai. Despite her critical role, she is known for her relaxed attitude and struggles to maintain her shrine. She frequently interacts with prominent residents of Gensokyo, including her close friend and occasional rival Marisa Kirisame, as well as Yukari Yakumo, who has a vested interest in the stability of Gensokyo's border.

Reimu's legend in Gensokyo is cemented through her constant resolution of incidents - a unique style of conflict-resolution in which she, as a shrine maiden, confronts and often battles other powerful beings to restore order. Her powers are considered nearly divine, with nearly "cheating" abilities marking her as one of Gensokyo's most formidable forces. She maintains a neutral stance in most conflicts but will intervene if any threat to Gensokyo's peace or her shrine arises.

### Adventure Hooks
Reimu will not very likely take any actions or assists player unless situation raises to an extend, but as many popular fandom concept, party might convince her into actions by donating some offering money to shrine, despite the original settings is that she has little idea about the value of money.
Besides encounter her during an incident, party may also meet her as she comes to save players from formidable youkari, or being too lazy and asks party for favors.


> ##### Author's Notes
> As the main heroine in Touhou Project, fandom interpretation of her power comes in various levels, but with a common ground that she always tend to beat everyone up regardless the situation and it always work. And as the heroine privilege, Reimu also has several cheating abilities, most notable one is "innate nature" (or Fantasy Heaven / Fantasy Nature) that renders she basically unbeatable. Feel free to change or add even more spell cards to her traditional D&D encounter when not in Danmaku Fight as necessary.
