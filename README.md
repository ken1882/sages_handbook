# Sage's Handbook - A Touhou Adaptation of the D&D 5E PHB

The Touhou Project is a vast and intricate universe. For anyone attempting to create a story that "makes sense" within this expansive world, it requires a great deal of study and effort to understand its depth and nuances.

When it comes to role-playing, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) provides a robust system for structuring narratives, offering clear rules to guide story progression and interactions. This makes it easier for players to immerse themselves in an adventure while following consistent guidelines.

The aim of this project is to adapt key elements from the Player's Handbook (PHB) of D&D 5E, reinterpreting them to fit within the world of Touhou. You'll find that some sections include notes and comments to explain how they align with both canon and fanon lore. Contributions to this project are very welcomed, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to help expand and refine this adaptation.
