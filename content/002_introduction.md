However, one critical thing must be awared, when a concept or an idea is written down, be spoken, or any other form that does that represent it as whole, it loses its original meaning. You, someone reading this book, very likely have your own preception of Gensokyo, and so do I. So, feel free to just take words inside this book as merely references to enrich your adventure in Gensokyo, and dynamically adapt, adjusting settings or rules necessarily that you find suitable.

## Adventure in Gensokyo
Gensokyo, literally meaning "Land of Illusions", is a secluded paradise separated with other multiverse by the Great Hakurei Barrier. Governed by ancient youkai, powerful mages, and enigmatic shrine maidens, Gensokyo is a haven where the ordinary and the extraordinary coexist in harmonious, albeit sometimes tumultuous, balance.

Various events can take place in Gensokyo, from a daily life in Human Village ti resolving an incident with engaging Touhou characters, is up to you. Note that if you're a human, you should be alerted on those man-eating Youkai here even with protections from Miko even some Youkai themselves.
