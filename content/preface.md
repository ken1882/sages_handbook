# Preface
Once upon a time, long, long, long ago, in a plane filled with astrals, lay a realm called Nihon. A man filled with indomitable will created a small fantasy world where shrine maiden and youkai coexisted. After countless intertwining of dreams and reality, a gap emerged from the boundaries, separating this world into a new plane, inherited from forgotten myths and echoes of mechanical signals from bygone eras. This world is known to the people as Gensokyo.


Sometimes, the boundaries between Gensokyo and the outside world blur. As people experience the picturesque landscapes and melodies of Gensokyo, their creative minds begin to weave their own tales. From mesmerizing fan art and captivating music remixes to engaging fan-made games, the community embraces the freedom to explore and expand the lore without legal concerns, thanks to ZUN-san’s welcoming attitude toward fan creations.


Despite the ever-changing tides of popular culture, Touhou has shown extraordinary resilience, standing the test of time for decades, supported by its passionate fanbase (not to mention ZUN san says himself as a doujin creator and the annually out-of-fashion memes XD). Unlike many modern franchises that rely heavily on large studios or commercialization, Touhou has remained an independent creation. The dedication and creativity of its fans have allowed it to become one of the longest-lasting and most influential properties in the modern world, distinct from traditional media.


However, the depth and complexity of the Touhou universe have grown to a level that newcomers might find daunting. Modern media often boasts high-quality animation for mainstream appeal. Touhou’s foundation lies in the original bullet-hell games and various doujin works, presenting a unique but challenging threshold to cross. For those willing to immerse themselves in Touhou's deep, intricate lore, the process of exploring and piecing together its vast world across various media is immensely rewarding. This threshold, though, can be seen as a double-edged sword; it not only deters casual exploration but also upholds the quality of the fanbase, ensuring that those who stay are truly invested.

One way to immerse in the vast Touhou world, and probably one of the best methods, is to role-play in this charming Gensokyo. Either you've got your own persona and are ready to head to the Gensokyo or simply playing as one of the canon characters. People often do RP runs on the social media and in the chats, but once a small scenario ventures deeper, there are often confusions of how things will go or what to decide in many ways. For those familiar with TRPG, they might already know that adapting a system is often a good choice, and the most popular ones are Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) and Call of Cthulhu (CoC).

D&D and CoC are both famous TRPGs but differ in many ways. One notable difference is the combat: D&D typically features sword and magic style with epic battles, whereas CoC is often set in a more modern world, where combat is less frequent and more deadly, so most players prefer to avoid direct confrontations.

Meanwhile, Touhou original as a bullet-hell game featuring spell cards and girls beating each other up, choosing D&D as adaptation is probably a better choice than inventing the wheel. Although, due to the complexity of the Touhou Project and innumerous characters and settings, it's still a big challenge and unavoidable brainstorming and studying in depth to reflect each Touhou's essence to its D&D stats. So, please don't expect everything will be the same as you think and feel free to open issues or pull requests in the project's repository. Cheers 2hu.
